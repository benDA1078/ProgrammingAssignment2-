# The following function written is a simply copy and paste from the "makeVector" example. I want to see if this is the answer to the solution or perhaps a hint of what is needed to be done. 

makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
        getmean <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setmean = setmean,
             getmean = getmean)
}
